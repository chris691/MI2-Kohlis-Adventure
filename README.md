# Prerequisites

You'll need Node.js, npm, and Parcel installed.

It is highly recommended to use Node Version Manager (nvm) to install Node.js and npm.

For Windows users there is Node Version Manager for Windows.

Install Node.js and npm with nvm:
```
nvm install node

nvm use node
```
Replace 'node' with 'latest' for nvm-windows.

Then install Parcel:
```
npm install -g parcel-bundler
```
# Getting Started

Start development server:
```
npm run start
```
